hello folks :) 

This is my minor project for the sixth semester. In this project with the help of machine learning algorithms primarily regression techniques like linear regression, Random Forest regression, AdaBoost Regression, XGboost regression, Support vector regression and Gradient boost regression we have tried to predict future gold prices.

## DATASET

Dataset we used in the process is saved by "__golddaily.csv__". It has daily gold price from 01 january 2014 to 01 january 2024. It has attributes of Price, Open, High, Low and change% . Source of dataset is INVESTING.COM and WORLD GOLD COUNCIL.
